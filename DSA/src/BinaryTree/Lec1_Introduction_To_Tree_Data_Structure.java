         🌳 TREE DATA STRUCTURE NOTES
         ============================================

         1️⃣ DEFINITION
         --------------------------------------------
         • A Tree is a NON-LINEAR, HIERARCHICAL data structure.
         • It consists of NODES connected by EDGES.
         • A tree does NOT contain cycles.
         • One node is chosen as the ROOT, and all others branch out from it.


         2️⃣ BASIC TERMINOLOGIES
         --------------------------------------------
         • ROOT → The topmost node of the tree (has no parent).
         • NODE → A fundamental unit of a tree that stores data.
         • PARENT → A node that has one or more child nodes
                    (immediate predecessor of a child).
         • CHILD → A node that is a direct successor of a parent.
         • SIBLINGS → Nodes that share the same parent.
         • LEAF NODE (External Node) → A node with no children (Degree = 0).
         • NON-LEAF NODE (Internal Node) → A node with at least one child.


         3️⃣ PROPERTIES OF TREE
         --------------------------------------------
         • EDGE → A connection between two nodes.
                  If a tree has N nodes → it has exactly (N - 1) edges.

         • ANCESTOR → Any predecessor node on the path
                       from the ROOT to that node.

         • DESCENDANT → Any successor node on the path
                         from a node to LEAF nodes.

         • SUBTREE → Any node along with all of its descendants.
                     Even a leaf node is considered a trivial subtree.


         4️⃣ DEGREE, DEPTH, HEIGHT & LEVELS
         --------------------------------------------
         • DEGREE OF NODE → Number of children of a node.
         • DEGREE OF TREE → Maximum degree among all nodes.

         • DEPTH OF NODE → Number of edges from ROOT to that node.

         • HEIGHT OF NODE → Number of edges on the longest path
                             from that node to a leaf.

         • HEIGHT OF TREE → Height of ROOT node = Longest path
                             from ROOT to any leaf node.

         • LEVEL → Distance from ROOT in terms of edges.
                   (Root = Level 0, children of root = Level 1, and so on)


         5️⃣ IMPORTANT POINTS
         --------------------------------------------
         • A tree is a special type of graph (without cycles).
         • Two main representations of tree:
              1. Linked Representation → Using nodes & pointers.
              2. Array Representation → Sequential storage.

         • Common Types of Trees:
              → Binary Tree → Each node has at most 2 children.
              → Binary Search Tree (BST) → Left child < Parent < Right child.
              → AVL Tree → Self-balancing BST.
              → Heap → Complete binary tree with heap property.
              → General Tree → No restriction on number of children.
